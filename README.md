# rust-brisbane-meetup-pipeline

Track and organise content for [Rust Brisbane meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-Brisbane/)

The repository is intended as a way to track topics that could/will be covered in a meetup.
The topics will not necessarily become content nor is anyone beholden to generating content,
the topics provide transparency on what participants want to see.

Meetup content can also be uploaded into the repository.
